# Improvements
Task list works only locally, unfortunetely I wasn't able to implement interaction with endpoints or implement tests. I have encountered obstacles like:
- problem with implementing HTTPClientComponent to Angular (I read that it was used in previous versions of Angular, now not supported),
- I wasn't working in the past with testing in Angular so it was challenging for me to implement tests,
Even if I wasn't able to implement some required components to my application, I found that they are not so hard to understand and apply.
With a bit of practise for sure I would understand profoundly usage of them and apply them in my future projects. I had a lot of fun doing Task
List and I posses a lot of enthusiasm to develop my skills and gain new knowledge in building web applications.
